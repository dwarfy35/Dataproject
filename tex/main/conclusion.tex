\chapter{Conclusion}
Overall the straight model proved to be more effective though not by much, and we were not really able to get a high enough AUC for this to be a viable method for predicting cancer diagnosis. However, we have seen that there is a possibly a different model that is able to pick up the signals from the cancer samples better than the models we created. As such we would say that to some degree this project has been a success, and that more iteration in this space would potentially lead to a more accurate model.
